# CM3015_MachineLearning_BreastCancerDetection
This was an exploratory machine learning project for detecting breast cancer from a dataset of images. This was the final submissions for the machine learning program CM3015.  

The dataset analysed for this project was selected and processed by me to detect malignant breast cancers. The algorithm managed to detect with a greater then 90% accuracy the correct label. However, this was indication of an unbalanced dataset, upon further inspection of the data selected in the closing statement of the report, it was confirmed that there was significant problem in the data. Solutions were further proposed to solve this issue going forward. This project served as a good example of the need for good datasets, or good sanitisation practices when dealing with machine learning. It also shows the significance of using a dataset that is large enough to account for discrepancies that show up in most datasets. 

Key technologies used:
* Python
* Keras machine learning library
* Jupyter notebooks

Dataset was acquired from kaggle:
